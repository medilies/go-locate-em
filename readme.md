Well Know Text (WKT): is a text-based format used to represent geometric objects, such as points, lines, and polygons in a standardized way, used in geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial databases to store and share spatial data.

```txt
POINT(-122.416667 37.783333)
```

```txt
POLYGON((30 10, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30 10))
```

The longitude (x-coordinate) is usually specified before the latitude (y-coordinate) when defining the points of a geometry. This convention is followed for most types of geometries, including points, lines, and polygons.
